# LTX Trainer

This package provides tools and scripts for training and fine-tuning
Lightricks' **LTX family** of audio-video generation models. It supports LoRA training, full
fine-tuning, and a flexible conditioning framework covering text-to-video, text-to-audio, image-to-video,
video extension, audio extension, video inpainting, audio inpainting, video outpainting, IC-LoRA for video, audio, and joint
audio-video references, audio-to-video, and video-to-audio.

### 🤖 Agent-Assisted Training

Use the [`train-model`](../../.claude/skills/train-model/SKILL.md) repository skill for an end-to-end guided run:
it probes your data and hardware, chooses the matching training mode, prepares/preprocesses the dataset, launches
training, and monitors the job while using the docs above as the source of truth.

## 🔧 Requirements

- **LTX Model** - Local files, in either published layout:
    - *Unified* (LTX-2, LTX-2.3, LTX-2.5) — one `.safetensors` holding the transformer, both VAEs and the vocoder,
      plus a directory containing the matching Gemma text encoder.
    - *Split* (LTX 2.5) — one file per component: transformer, packed text encoder, video VAE, audio VAE. Each is
      named separately in the config; see [Configuration Reference](docs/configuration-reference.md#modelconfig).
- **Matching text encoder** - LTX 2.5 requires the LTX-specific fine-tuned Gemma 4 text encoder; do not substitute
  Google's vanilla Gemma 4 model. LTX-2/LTX-2.3 use Gemma 3.
- **Linux with CUDA** - CUDA 13+ recommended for optimal performance
- **Nvidia GPU with 80GB+ VRAM** - Recommended for the standard config. For GPUs with 32GB VRAM (e.g., RTX 5090),
  use the [low VRAM config](configs/t2v_lora_low_vram.yaml) which enables INT8 quantization and other
  memory optimizations
