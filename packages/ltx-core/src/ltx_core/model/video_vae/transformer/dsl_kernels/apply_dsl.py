    """Install CuTe DSL attention + fused deferred stage-5 blocks.
    Runs on the meta model before weights exist: the softmax bound (NaN sentinel) and
    the fused-context weights get empty buffers here, which
    ``video_decoder_sd_ops_for_checkpoint(na_dsl_kernel=True)`` fills at load. The two
    must be paired -- ``ltx_pipelines.utils.blocks.VideoDecoder`` does that from one
    flag; a custom builder that applies this without the matching SDOps fails at first
    forward (meta / NaN / empty fused buffers), not at install.
    GPU capability is *not* gated here so wiring can be unit-tested on any host; the
    kernel launchers still require datacenter Blackwell + cutlass-dsl. Callers that
    build a runnable decoder (e.g. ``VideoDecoder``) should still refuse early via
    ``na_dsl_available()``.
    Every block must already carry its ``stage4_upsample`` -- ``load_state_dict`` checks
    shapes even with ``assign=True``, so the fused buffers can only be registered once
    the hop that decides their shape is known.
    The stage-4 ``upsamples[3].proj`` and each block's ``context_proj`` stay on the
    module after install: the hot path reads only the fused buffers, but the Linears
    remain as load/shape ballast (and for reference / non-fused comparisons).
