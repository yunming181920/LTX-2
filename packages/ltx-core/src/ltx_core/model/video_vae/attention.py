class AttnBlock3D(nn.Module):
    r"""Single-head per-frame spatial self-attention block.
    Frames are folded into the batch dimension and attention is computed over
    H*W per frame -- no cross-frame interaction.
    The block is single-head, matching the reference implementation. An
    ``attention_head_dim`` carried in the VAE block config is intentionally not
    honored: the reference (which trained the checkpoints) is single-head, and a
    real-image encode/decode round-trip on the 16x16x4 checkpoint reconstructs at
    ~29 dB PSNR, confirming the single-head layout is the faithful one.
    Args:
        in_channels: The number of input channels.
        attention: The attention backend, given either as an :class:`AttentionFunction`
            enum (resolved once here via :meth:`~AttentionFunction.to_callable`) or as an
            already-resolved :class:`AttentionCallable`. Defaults to the PyTorch (SDPA)
            backend rather than ``AUTOMATIC``: this block is single-head, so
            ``head_dim == in_channels``, which exceeds the FlashAttention head-dim limit at
            the VAE bottleneck. SDPA's dispatcher falls back to an efficient/math kernel for
            such large head dims, whereas ``AUTOMATIC`` would hand back a raw flash kernel on
            Hopper/Blackwell that the kernel cannot serve.
